    <h2>Ambition</h2>
	<hr>
    <p>Decising an ambition is a confusing task for each and everyone of us. The same is the case with me. Although i am pursuing B.Tech in MEMS but 
	now I have not decided whether i want to go in core or non-core, whether i want to branch change or not. Deciding these things are extremely 
	confusing for me now and I hope them to get clearer with time.<br> Other than that my present focus is mainly on improving my 
	<b>coding skills</b> be it <i>Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</i> or any other related language and my <b>designing skills</b> which mainly 
	include <i>Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop</i>.</p>
